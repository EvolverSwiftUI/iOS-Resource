# CODE REVIEW PRINCIPLES
1. DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
2. YAGNI = You Aren't Gonna Need It


# Course structure 🎓

The program is structured into 6 modules to cover all aspects of developing modern iOS/Swift apps in a linear and organized way:

Module 1 - Planning and System Design: The fundamentals of good system design and architecture. You'll learn how to think, design, and draw diagrams like a software architect. The goal is for you to start with the right foot, forming a solid foundation where you can stack the upcoming knowledge.

Module 2 - Networking: You'll code following networking best practices and learn how to develop, maintain, and test a clean networking layer in your iOS apps with key frameworks such as URLSession, URLProtocol, Decodable, and third-party code. You'll also learn how to work effectively with backend teams.

Module 3 - Persistence: You'll code and learn step-by-step how to effectively tackle challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and testing a clean persistence layer in your iOS apps using URLCache, CoreData, FileManager, Codable, and other key persistence frameworks.

Module 4 - UI and Presentation: UI, UX, and Presentation best practices, and how to develop, maintain, and test a clean UI and Presentation layer in your iOS applications. You'll code and learn how to use MVC, MVVM, MVP, and their variants, prototyping techniques, localizing your apps, working effectively with designers, and how to create reusable UI/Presentation components.

Module 5 - Main: Learn how to compose modules to form a fully functional app, including app navigation and custom flows. You'll also learn how to validate high-level acceptance criteria with automated tests at every level (Unit, Integration, Snapshot, and UI tests). You'll code following best practices, including how to use the Combine framework and how to develop, maintain, and test-drive a clean Composition layer in your iOS applications.

Module 6 - Bonus live lectures: Learn how to develop better apps faster with ready solutions to common challenges such as pagination with caching, navigation, dependency injection, generic and reusable components, performance optimizations, logging, profiling, and modularization in large apps.

Extras: Throughout the program, you'll find a lot of supplementary material. There are over 60 video lectures. Every video lecture comes with captions/subtitles, an accompanying article, source code, diagrams, and references.

You'll learn how to become a complete senior developer following principles and practices such as:

<ol>
<li>Version control with git</li>
<li>Memory Management</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Functional Programming</li>
<li>Clean Architecture</li>
<li>Modular Design</li>
<li>Design Principles and Patterns</li>
<li>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
<li>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</li>
<li>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</li>
<li>Command-Query Separation</li>
<li>Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Composite Reuse (Prefer composition over inheritance)</li>
<li>Functional Core, Imperative Shell</li>
<li>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</li>
<li>You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)</li>
<li>Use Case analysis</li>
<li>Domain Modeling</li>
<li>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</li>
<li>Automated Tests</li>
<li>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Integration Testing</li>
<li>Snapshot Testing</li>
<li>UI Testing</li>
<li>Acceptance Testing</li>
<li>End-to-end Testing</li>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Concurrency and Threading</li>
<li>Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment</li>
<li>You learn by developing a real-world iOS app from scratch all the way to the App Store.</li>
<ol>  

The first time you're going through the program, you'll learn and practice by implementing the features as seen in the lecture.

You'll build a complete app using our methodology, from an empty project to deploying it to App Store Connect.

We will help you along the way, but we can't do the work for you. You need to be committed to doing the work.

As you progress, you should apply the methodology at work and on side-projects too. The aim is for you to build up your skills and apply what you learned to solve different problems in your real-life work.

Applying this methodology to solve any problem at work is the ultimate goal.

You'll also have challenges along the way to test your skills.

We review all your assignments on GitHub and provide you with detailed feedback. You can also access everyone else's assignments and code reviews, so everyone learns together.
And you'll interact with us and the community of students when you have questions. We'll personally reply to you.

But it's up to you to decide if you want to participate actively or go on your own.

There are two ways you can take this program:

1. By watching the recorded material and practicing on your own - at your own pace.

2. Or by also completing the challenges on GitHub and joining the discussions, community Q&As, mentoring sessions, live lectures, and virtual events.
